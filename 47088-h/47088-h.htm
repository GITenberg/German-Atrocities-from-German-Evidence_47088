<p>I intend to prove that the German armies cannot
wholly escape from the reproach of sometimes violating
the law of nations, and I mean to prove my case according
to French custom from absolutely trust worthy sources.</p>

<p>I shall make use only of documents most rigorously
examined, and I have taken care to criticize their text as
minutely as if in times of peace I were questioning the
authority of some old chronicle or the genuineness of some
old chart. And I shall do so perhaps from professional
habit, perhaps impelled by an inward longing to get
at the truth, in any case for the good of the case I am
pleading: for these pages are intended for every one; for
the casual reader, for the indifferent, and indeed for the
enemy of my country. I wish that the casual reader who
may by chance open this pamphlet in an idle moment
should be struck by the genuineness of the documents,
if he has eyes to see, just as their sordid character will
touch his heart, if he has a heart that feels.</p>

<p>My aim has been that these documents whose authenticity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
is obvious should carry an equally obvious authority.
It is easy to make accusations difficult to prove them! No
belligerent has ever been at a loss to bring against his
enemy a heap of evidence, true or false. But though the
evidence may be collected in accordance the most solemn
forms of justice by the highest magistrates, it will unfortunately
long remain useless, so long as the adversary has
not had an opportunity of disputing it, everyone is entitled
to consider statements as lies, or at least as open to refutation.
That is why, I shall abstain here, from quoting
French or Belgian testimony true though I know it to be.
I have preferred that the evidence which I shall call shall
be of such a nature that no living man, not even in Germany
shall attempt to refute it. German atrocities shall
be proved by German documents.</p>

<p>I shall take the evidence chiefly from those war diaries,
which Article 75 of the <i>Rules for Field service of the
German Army</i> advises soldiers to keep on the march,
which we have confiscated from prisoners<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>, as being
military papers. It goes without saying that their number
increases daily. I should like some day the complete
collection to be deposited in the collection of German
manuscripts in the Bibliothèque Nationale for everyone&#8217;s
instruction. In the meantime, the Marquis of Dampierre,
a former student of the École des Chartes, archivist and
paleographer, is preparing and will shortly bring out a
book in which the greater part of these roadside journals
will be minutely described, copied, and brought into the
full light of day. For my part I have examined but forty.
They will suffice for my task. I shall make some extracts
from them, taking care that each quotation bears sufficient
proof of its genuineness.</p>

<p>In what order shall I arrange them? For many reasons,
but chiefly because some of these documents only ten lines
long contain proof of crimes of many kinds, I shall not
attempt to adopt any rigid order of classification. I shall dip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
haphazard into the heap; certain associations of ideas
or pictures, and a certain similarity in the texts will alone
enable me to
group them.</p>

<p>I open haphazard
the Diary
of a soldier of
the Prussian
Guard, Gefreiter
Paul Spielmann
(I Kompagnie,
Ersatz-Bataillon,
I Garde-Infanterie-Brigade).
Here is
his account of a
night alarm in a
village near Blamont
on the
1<sup>st</sup> September. At
the bugle call,
the Guard wakes,
and the
massacre begins
(<i>Plates 1 and 2</i>.)</p>

<blockquote>

<p>«The inhabitants
fled through the village. It was horrible. Blood was plastered
on all the houses, and as for the faces of the dead, they
were hideous. They were all buried at once, to the number of
sixty. Among them many old men and women, and one woman
about to be delivered. It was a ghastly sight. There were three
children who had huddled close to one another and had died
together. The altar and the ceiling of the church had fallen in.
They had been telephoning to the enemy. And this morning,
2 September, all the survivors were driven out and I saw four
little boys carrying on two poles a cradle in which was a child
of 5 to 6 months old. All this was horrible to see. A blow for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
a blow. Thunder
for thunder.
Everything was
pillaged. And I
also saw a mother
with her
two little ones:
and one had a
large wound in
the head, and
had lost an
eye.»<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p></blockquote>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 377px;">
<img src="images/plate2.jpg" width="377" height="599" alt="" />
<span class="caption"><i>Plate 2.</i></span>
</div>

<p>«They had
been telephoning
to the Enemy»
says this
soldier, the punishment
was
deserved. Let
us remember
the terms of
Art. 50 of the
Hague Convention
of 1907
signed in the
name of the
German Emperor
by a gentleman, Baron Marschall von Bieberstein.
«No collective punishment, pecuniary or other, can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
inflicted upon a community for individual acts for which
they cannot be held responsible as a body.» What tribunal,
during this night of horrors took the trouble to make
sure of the guilt of the community at large?</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>In an unsigned note-book of a soldier belonging to the
32<sup>nd</sup> Infantry (IV Reserve Corps) we come across the
following statement.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>«3<sup>rd</sup> September. <i>Creil.</i> The iron bridge has been blown up.
Consequently we burnt the streets and shot the civilians.»<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The regular French troops alone&mdash;the Engineers&mdash;had
blown up the iron bridge at Creil; the civilians had nothing
to do with it. To excuse these massacres, when they condescend
to make any excuse these note-books usually say:
&#8220;<i>civilians</i>&#8221; and &#8220;<i>sharpshooters</i>&#8221; had fired on our men.
But the Convention of 1907, that &#8220;scrap of paper&#8221;, signed
by Germany, stipulates that by its first Article the laws,
rights, and duties of war apply, not only to the army, but
also to the militia and volunteer corps, adding certain conditions,
the chief one of which is the bearing of arms openly
and in Art. 2. &#8220;The population of unoccupied territory,
who, at the approach of the enemy, spontaneously take up
arms against the invading forces without having had time
to organize according to the conditions of Art. 1, shall be
considered as belligerent, if the population bears arms
openly and respects the laws and customs of war.&#8221; Read
in the light of this text the savage stories which follow
will take their true proportions:</p>

<p><i>a</i>) <i>Diary of P<sup>te</sup> Hassemer</i> VIII Corps.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>«3. 9. 1914. Sommepy (Marne). Horrible massacre. The village
burnt to the ground, the French thrown into houses in flames,
civilians and all burnt together.»<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><i>b</i>) <i>Diary of Lt Kietzmann</i> (2<sup>nd</sup> Company, 1<sup>st</sup> Battalion of
the 49<sup>th</sup> Reg<sup>t</sup> of Infantry), dated 18<sup>th</sup> August (<i>Plate 3</i>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 583px;">
<img src="images/plate3.jpg" width="583" height="600" alt="" />
<span class="caption"><i>Plate 3.</i></span>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p>«A little in front of Diest<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> lies the village of Schaffen. About
50 civilians had hidden in the church tower and had fired on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
our men with a machine-gun. All the civilians were shot.»<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><i>c</i>) <i>Diary of a Saxon officer</i> (<i>unsigned</i>) (178<sup>th</sup> Reg<sup>t</sup> XII Army
Corps, I Saxon Corps).</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;26<sup>th</sup> August. The pretty village of Gué-d&#8217;Hossus in the
Ardennes has been burnt, although innocent of any crime, it
seemed to me. I was told a cyclist had fallen off his machine,
and that in doing so his gun had gone off: so they fired in
his direction. Thereupon, the male inhabitants were simply
consigned to the flames. It is to be hoped that such atrocities
will not be repeated.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The Saxon officer however had already seen such &#8220;atrocities&#8221;
the previous day, 25<sup>th</sup> August, at Villers en Fagne
(Belgian Ardennes). &#8220;Where some Grenadiers of the Guard
had been found dead or wounded&#8221;, he had seen the priest
and other villagers shot; and three days earlier the 23<sup>rd</sup> August,
in the village of Bouvignes to the north of Dinant, he
had seen things which he describes as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;We got into the property of a well-to-do inhabitant, by a
breach effected in the rear, and we occupied the house. Through
a maze of rooms we reached the threshold. There was the
body of the owner on the floor. Inside our men destroyed
everything, like Vandals. Every corner was searched. Outside
in the country, the sight of the villagers who had been shot
defies all description. The volley had almost decapitated some
of them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Every house had been searched to the smallest corner, and
the inhabitants dragged from their hiding-places. The men
were shot; the women and children shut up in a convent, from
which some shots were fired. Consequently, the convent is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
to be burnt. It can be ransomed however on the surrender of
the guilty and on payment of 15.000 francs.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Sometimes, as we shall see, the diaries supplement one
another.</p>

<p><i>d</i>) <i>Diary of Private Philipp.</i> (Kamenz, Saxony. 1<sup>st</sup> Company.
1<sup>st</sup> Battalion of the 178<sup>th</sup> Regt.) The same day
23<sup>rd</sup> August, a soldier of the same regiment saw a similar
scene to that described above, probably the same, but the
point of view is a different one (<i>Plate 4</i>).</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;In the evening, at 10 o&#8217;clock the first battalion of the 178<sup>th</sup>
Regt went down to the village that had been burnt to the north of
Dinant. A sad and beautiful sight, and one that made you
shudder. At the entrance of the village there lay about 50 dead
bodies strewn on the road. They had been shot for having fired
on our troops from ambush. In the course of the night, many
others were shot in the same way, so that we could count
more than two hundred. The women and children, lamp in
hand, were obliged to watch the horrible scene. We then ate
our rice, in the midst of the corpses, for we had not tasted
food since morning.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p></blockquote>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 366px;">
<img src="images/plate4.jpg" width="366" height="600" alt="" />
<span class="caption"><i>Plate 4.</i></span>
</div>

<p>A fine military subject indeed, and worthy to compete
at the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts. One passage in
the text however is obscure, and might embarrass the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
competitors. &#8220;The women and children lamp in hand
were obliged to watch the horrible scene.&#8221;</p>

<p>What scene? The shooting, or the counting of the
corpses? Painters, who wish to elucidate this point need
only consult the colonel of the 178<sup>th</sup> Regt. What a gallant
soldier!</p>

<p>He did, that night, but carry out the spirit of his superiors
and comrades in arms. He who wishes to be
convinced need but read in the Sixth Report of the Belgian
Enquiry Commission on the violation of the laws of nations
(Le Havre, 10 Nov. 1914) the base proclamations which
the Germans placarded in Belgium. Three short excerpts
will suffice.</p>

<p class="spaced">Extract from a Proclamation of General von Bülow
posted up at Liège on the 22<sup>nd</sup> of August 1914:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="spaced">&#8220;The inhabitants of the town of Andenne, after having
protested their peaceful intentions, treacherously surprised
our troops. It is with my full consent that the general
in command had the whole place burnt, and about a hundred
people were shot.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p class="spaced">&#8220;Everyone who does not at once obey the word of command
&#8220;Hands up!&#8221; is guilty (<i>sic</i>) of the penalty of death.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>&#8220;In future, all places near the spot where such acts have
taken place (destruction of railway lines or telegraph wires)&mdash;<i>no

<h3>III</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 373px;">
<img src="images/plate5.jpg" width="373" height="599" alt="" />
<span class="caption"><i>Plate 5.</i></span>
</div>

<p>This (<i>Plate 5</i>)
is the first page
of an unsigned
note-book:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<i>Langeviller</i>,
22 August. Village
destroyed by the
11<sup>th</sup> Battalion of
the Pioneers.
Three women
hanged on trees:
the first dead
I have seen.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>Who are these three women? Criminals surely, guilty
no doubt of having fired on the German troops, unless
they had been telephoning to the enemy; and the
11<sup>th</sup> Pioneers had no doubt punished them justly. But
they have expiated
their crime
now, and the
11<sup>th</sup> Pioneers have
gone by, and
of their crime, the
newly advancing
troops know nothing.
Among
these new troops
will there be a
commander, a
Christian, to order
the cords to
be cut and to
release these
dead women. No,
the regiment will
march by under
the gibbets, and
the flags will
brush by these
corpses; they will
pass along Colonel
and officers,
gentlemen and
<i>Kulturträger</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 338px;">
<img src="images/plate6.jpg" width="338" height="599" alt="" />
<span class="caption"><i>Plate 6</i>.</span>
</div>

<p>And they know
full well what
they are doing: these dead women must remain these,
as an example; as an example, not for the other women in
the village&mdash;these had already no doubt understood&mdash;, but
as an example for the regiment, and for other regiments
who were to come afterwards. These must be made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
warlike, they must be taught their duty, that is to shoot
women when the opportunity occurs. The lesson bore
fruit indeed. Here is sufficient proof: the young soldier
who had that day seen and told us of &#8220;dead for the first
time&#8221; makes the following note on the 10<sup>th</sup> and last page
of his diary (<i>Plate 6</i>).</p>

<p>&#8220;In this way we destroyed 8 houses with their inmates.
In one of them two men with their wives and a girl of eighteen
were bayonetted. The little one almost unnerved me so innocent
was her expression. But it was impossible to check the

longer men, but wild beasts.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>And to prove that this murder of women and children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
is all in the days work of the German soldier, here is
further evidence.</p>

<p><i>a</i>) The author of an unsigned note-book (<i>Plate 7</i>) relates
that at Orchies (Nord) a woman was shot for not having stopped
at the word
of command
<i>Halt!</i> Thereupon,
he adds, the
whole place was
burnt.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p><i>b</i>) The officer
already mentioned
of the 178<sup>th</sup>
Saxon Regt reports
that in the
outskirts of Lisognes
(Belgian
Ardennes) &#8220;a
scout from Marburg
having placed
three women
one behind the
other brought
them all down
with one shot&#8221;.</p>

<img src="images/plate8.jpg" width="367" height="600" alt="" />
<span class="caption"><i>Plate 8.</i></span>
</div>

<p><i>c</i>) Let us now
quote a few lines
from the diary
of a reservist a
certain Schlauter
(3<sup>rd</sup> Battery of the 4<sup>th</sup> Regt, Field Artillery of the Guard,
<i>Plate 8</i>):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>25<sup>th</sup> August (in Belgium): Three hundred of the inhabitants
were shot and the survivors were requisitioned as grave-diggers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
You should have seen the women at this moment! But you can&#8217;t
do otherwise. During our march on Wilot, things went better:
the inhabitants who wished to leave could do so and go where
they liked.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> But anyone who fired was shot. When we left
Owele, shots were fired: but there, women and everything
were fired on<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>....</p></blockquote>

<p>Often when German troops wish to carry a position,
they place civilians, men, women and children before
them, and take shelter behind this shield of living flesh. As
the stratagem consists essentially in speculating upon
the noblemindedness of the adversary, of saying to him:
&#8220;You will not fire upon these unhappy people, I know,
and I hold you at my mercy, disarmed, because I know you
are less cowardly than I&#8221;, as it implies a homage to the
enemy, and humiliation of oneself, it is almost inconceivable
that soldiers can resort to it, and that is why it
represents a new invention in the long list of human cruelties,
and the most fearful <i>Penitentiels</i> (<i>Summæ peccatorum</i>)
of the middle ages have not recorded it. And it is also
why, in presence of accounts, French, English or Belgian
accusing the Germans of such practices I for a long time
doubted, I admit if not the truth of the evidence, at least its
importance: such acts must, it seemed to me, prove only the
unavowed crimes of officers, individual acts which do not
dishonour a nation, for a nation on learning them would
repudiate them. But now can we doubt that the German
nation accepts such ruffianly exploits as worthy of her, that
she recognizes and acquiesces in them, when the following
narrative, signed by a Bavarian officer, Lt. A. Eberlein is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
laid before us in one of the best known newspapers in
Germany, in the issue of 7<sup>th</sup> Oct. 1914 (n<sup>o</sup> 513 <i>Vorabendblatt</i>
p. 2 of the
<i>Münchner Neueste Nachrichten</i>)?
Lt Eberlein
describes the occupation
of St Dié at the end of
August. After entering the
town at the head of a
column, he was obliged
to barricade himself inside
a house until reinforcements
came up (<i>Plate
9</i>):</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 190px;">
<img src="images/plate9.jpg" width="190" height="600" alt="" />
<span class="caption"><i>Plate 9.</i></span>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p>We had arrested three
civilians, and suddenly a
good idea struck me. We
placed them on chairs and
made them understand that
they must go and sit on them
in the middle of the street.
On one side entreaties, on
the other blows from the
butt-end of a gun. One gets
terribly hardened after a
while. At last they were
seated outside in the street.
I do not know how many
prayers of anguish they
said; but they kept their
hands tightly clasped all
the time. I pitied them;
but the devise worked
immediately. The shooting
at us from the house at the
side stopped at once; we
were able to occupy the
house in front, and became
masters of the principal
street. Every one after that
who showed himself in the
street was shot. The artil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>lery,
too did good work during this, and when towards seven
in the evening, the brigade advanced to free us, I was able to
report that &#8220;St Dié is free of the enemy&#8221;.</p>

<p>As I learnt later on, the ... regiment of reserve which had
entered St Dié more from the north had had similar experiences
to ours. The four civilians that had been made to sit
in the street had been killed by French bullets. I saw them
myself, stretched out in the middle of the street, near the Hospital.</p></blockquote>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>Article 28 of the Hague Convention of 1907, signed by
Germany, runs thus &#8220;It is forbidden to pillage a town or
locality even when taken by assault.&#8221; Article 47 runs: &#8220;(In
occupied territory), pillage is forbidden&#8221;.</p>

<p>This is how the armies of Germany interpret these
articles.</p>

<p>Private Handschuhmacher (of the 11 battalion of Jägers,
reserve) writes in his diary:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;8<sup>th</sup> August 1914. <i>Gouvy</i>, (Belgium). There as the Belgians had
fired on German soldiers we at once pillaged the Goods Station.
Some cases, eggs, shirts and all eatables were seized. The safe
was gutted and the money divided among the men. All
securities were torn up.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>This took place on the fourth day of the war and
enables us to understand why in a technical article on the
Military Treasury (<i>der Zahlmeister im Felde</i>) the <i>Berliner
Tageblatt</i> of the 26<sup>th</sup> Nov. 1914 (1 Supplement) notices as a
mere incident an economic phenomenon which is however
curious: &#8220;As it is a fact that far more money orders are
sent from the theatre of operations to the interior of the
country than vice versa ...&#8221; «<i>Da nun aber erfahrungsgemäss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
viel mehr Geld vom Kriegsschauplatz nach der Heimat gesandt
wird</i> ...».</p>

<p>But as, according to the common practice of the German
armies, pillage is but the prelude to incendiarism, non-commissioned-officer
Hermann Levith (of the 160<sup>th</sup> Regt.
VIII<sup>th</sup> Army Corps) writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;The enemy had occupied the village of Bièvre and the skirts
of the wood. The 3<sup>rd</sup> Company advanced in first line. We carried
the village and pillaged and burnt nearly all the houses.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>And P<sup>te</sup> Schiller (133 Inf. XIX<sup>th</sup> Corps) writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;It was at Haybes (Ardennes) on the 24<sup>th</sup> of August that we
had our first battle. The 2<sup>nd</sup> Battalion entered the village,
searched the houses sacked them and burnt all those from which
shots had been fired.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Private Seb. Reishaupt (3 Bavarian Inf. 1<sup>st</sup> Bavarian
Corps) writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;Parux (Meurthe-et-Moselle) is the first village we burnt;
then the dance began: villages one after the other; by field
and meadow on bicycle to the ditches by the roadside, there
we ate cherries.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>They vie with one another in stealing, they steal
everything and anything, and they keep a record of their
loot: &#8220;<i>Schnaps, Wein, Marmelade, Zigarren</i>&#8221; so writes this
plain soldier; and the smart officer of the 178<sup>th</sup> Saxon, who
at first was indignant at the &#8220;Vandalismus&#8221; of his men,
confesses in his turn, that the 1<sup>st</sup> of September at Rethel,
he stole &#8220;in a house near the <i>Hôtel Moderne</i>, a splendid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
mackintosh and a camera for Felix&#8221;. Without distinction of
grade, nor of arms, nor of Corps, they steal, and even
in the ambulances the doctors steal. Here is an example
from the diary of Private Johannes Thode (4. Reserve-Ersatz
Regiment):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;Brussels 5. 10. 14. A motor arrives at the hospital with booty,
a piano, two sewing machines, a lot of albums and all sorts of
other things.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Two sewing machines, as «booty» (<i>Kriegsbeute</i>). Stolen
from whom? No doubt from two humble Belgian women.
And for whom?</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>I must admit that out of the forty diaries I have examined,
there are six or seven that tell of no exactions, either from
hypocritical reticence or because certain regiments wage
war less vilely. And I even know of three diaries, whose
authors, as they narrate sordid details, are astonished,
moved to indignation, saddened. I shall withhold their
names, because they deserve our consideration, and to
spare them the risk of being one day blamed or punished.
The first, P<sup>te</sup> X ..., who belongs to the 65<sup>th</sup> Inf. of the Landwehr,
says of some of his fellow comrades (<i>Plate 10</i>):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;They do not behave like soldiers, but like common thieves,
highwaymen and robbers, and are a disgrace to our regiment and
our army.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The second, Lt Y ..., of the 77<sup>th</sup> Inf. Reserve, says:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p><blockquote>

<p>&#8220;No discipline ... The Pioneers are not worth much;
as for the artillerymen they are a gang of robbers.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p></blockquote>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 394px;">
<img src="images/plate10.jpg" width="394" height="600" alt="" />
<span class="caption"><i>Plate 10.</i></span>
</div>

<p>And the third, Private Z ..., 12<sup>th</sup> Inf. Reserve (1 Corps
Reserves) writes
(<i>Plate 11</i>):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;Unfortunately,
I am obliged
to mention something
which
ought never to
have happened;
but there are even
in our army ruffians
who are no
longer men, swine
to whom nothing
is sacred.
One of them entered
a sacristy that
was locked, in
which was the
blessed sacrament.
Out of respect
a <i>protestant</i>
avoided sleeping
there; he polluted
the place with his
excrements. How
can there be such
beings! Last
night, a man of the
Landwehr, a man of thirty-five, and a married man, tried to rape
the daughter of a man in whose house he had been quartered,
she was a child; and as the father tried to interpose he kept
the point of his bayonet on the man&#8217;s breast.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption"><i>Plate 11.</i></span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>With the exception of these soldiers, who are worthy of
the name, the thirty other writers are the same, and the same
soul, if the word be allowed, seems to animate them all,
uncontrolled and low. They are all alike, yet with some
shades of difference. There are some who make distinctions,
like subtle lawyers, sometimes blaming, sometimes disapproving:
&#8220;<i>Dort war ein Exempel am Platze</i>&#8221;. And there are
some who sneer: &#8220;<i>Krieg ist Krieg</i>&#8221;; or in French, by preference
to add to their scorn &#8220;<i>Ja, ja, c&#8217;est la guerre</i>&#8221;; and
there are some who having done their ugly work, open their
Hymn Book, and sing psalms: for instance the Saxon
officer Rieslang, who relates how one day he left a feast to
go to &#8220;Gottesdienst&#8221;, but was obliged to leave hurriedly,
having eaten and drunk too much; or again Private Moritz
Grosse of the 177<sup>th</sup> Inf. who after describing the sack of
St Vieth (22<sup>nd</sup> August) and that of Dinant (23<sup>rd</sup> August)
writes this sentence (<i>Plate 12</i>):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Throwing of bombs in the houses. In the evening, military
chorale: <i>Nun danket alle Gott</i> (Now, thank ye all God).<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>They are all alike. Now, if we consider that I could
substitute for the preceding examples others similar and
no less cynical, taken for instance from the diary of the
reservist Lautenschlager, of the 1<sup>st</sup> Battalion of the 66<sup>th</sup>
Inf. Reg<sup>t</sup>, or from the diary of P<sup>te</sup> Eduard Hohl of the
VIII Corps, or from the diary of non-commissioned officer
Rheinhold Koehn, of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Battalion of Pomeranian Pioneers,
or from the diary of the non-commissioned officer
Otto Brandt of the 2<sup>nd</sup> section of the ambulance corps
(reserves) or from the diary of the Reservist Martin Muller,
of the 100<sup>th</sup> Saxon Reserves, or from the diary of Lt Karl
Zimmer, of the 55<sup>th</sup> Inf. or from the diary of P<sup>te</sup> Erich
Pressler of the 100<sup>th</sup> Grenadiers, 1<sup>st</sup> Saxon Corps, etc.; and
if we notice, that among the extracts already given, there
are very few isolated cases of brutality (as can be and are
found, alas in the most noble minded of armies) and that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
have scarcely noted here any crime that was not done by
order, any crime that does not implicate and dishonour
not only the individual soldier, but the whole regiment,
the officer, the
very nation;
and if we consider
that these
thirty diaries,
whether they
be Bavarian or
Saxon, Baden
or Rhenish,
Pomeranian or
from Brandenburg,
taken haphazard
must
represent hundreds
and
thousands of
similar ones,
all of a fearful
monotony, we
shall be obliged
to allow, I
think, that,
M. René Viviani
in no way
overstated the
case when from
the French tribune
he spoke
of &#8220;this system
of collective
murder and pillage which Germany calls war&#8221;.</p>

<h3>VII</h3>

<p>H. M. the German Emperor, in ratifying the Hague Convention
of 1907 agreed (Article 23) &#8220;that it is forbidden ... (c)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
to kill or wound an enemy, who having laid down his arms
and having no means of self-defence, gives himself up as a
prisoner; (d) to declare that no quarter will be given&#8221;.</p>

<p>Has the German Army respected these conventions? In
the French and Belgian reports, evidence is plentiful resembling
the following which comes from a Frenchman captain
in the 288<sup>th</sup> Infantry: &#8220;On the evening of the 22<sup>nd</sup> I
learnt that in the wood a hundred and fifty metres from the
cross-roads formed by the intersection of the great
trench at Calonne and the road from Vaux-lès-Palameix
to St Rémy there were some dead bodies of French soldiers
who had been shot by the Germans.</p>

<p>I went there, and saw some thirty soldiers in a small space,
for the most part lying down, some however on their knees
and all having <i>the same kind of wound, a gun-shot in the ear</i>.
Only one, very severely wounded was able to speak. He
told me the Germans had, before leaving, ordered them to
lie down, then had killed them by a shot through the head;
that he had been spared on telling them he was the father
of three small children. Their brainpans had been blown
some distance away, the guns broken at the stock were
scattered here and there, and the blood had so bespattered
the bushes that as I came out of the wood the front of
my cape was all smeared with blood; it was a real charnel-house.&#8221;</p>

<p>I have quoted this man&#8217;s testimony, not to rely on it as
evidence but merely to make clear the nature of my indictment;
as for justifying it I shall take care not to depart from
the rule I have laid down to resort to German sources of
information only.</p>

<p>Here is an order of the day given on the 26<sup>th</sup> August by
General Stenger commanding the 58<sup>th</sup> German Brigade to
his troops:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Von heute ab werden keine Gefangene mehr gemacht. Sämtliche
Gefangene werden niedergemacht. Verwundete ob mit
Waffen oder Wehrlos niedergemacht. Gefangene auch in grösseren
6 geschlossenen Formationen werden niedergemacht. Es
bleibe kein Feind lebend hinter uns.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Oberleutnant und Kompagnie-Chef <span class="smcap">Stoy</span>; Oberst und Regiments-Kommandeur
<span class="smcap">Neubauer</span>; General-Major und Brigade-Kommandeur
<span class="smcap">Stenger</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Translation.</span> After to-day no more prisoners will be taken.
All prisoners are to be killed. Wounded, with or without arms,
are to be killed. Even prisoners already grouped in convoys are
to be killed. Let not a single living enemy remain behind us.</p></blockquote>

<p>Some thirty soldiers of Stenger&#8217;s Brigade (112 and 142<sup>nd</sup> Reg<sup>t</sup>
of the Baden Infantry), were examined in our prisoners
camps. I have read their evidence, which they gave upon
oath and signed. All confirm the statement that this order
of the day was given them on the 26th August, in one unit
by Major Mosebach, in another by Lt Curtius, etc.; the
majority did not know whether the order was carried out;
but three of them say they saw it done in the forest of
Thiaville, where ten or twelve wounded French soldiers
who had already been spared by a battalion were despatched;
two others saw the order carried out on the Thiaville
road, where some wounded found in a ditch by a company
were finished off.</p>

<p>No doubt, I cannot produce the autograph of General Stenger,
and it is not for me to communicate the names of the
German prisoners who gave this evidence. But I have no
difficulty in producing here German autographs in proof of
crimes precisely similar.</p>

<p>For example (<i>Plate 13</i>), here is an extract from P<sup>te</sup> Albert
Delfosse&#8217;s diary (III Inf. Reserve, XIV Reserve Corps):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;In the forest of St Rémy, 4<sup>th</sup> or 5<sup>th</sup> September, saw a fine
cow and calf destroyed and once more corpses of Frenchmen,
frightfully mutilated.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p></blockquote>

<img src="images/plate13.jpg" width="370" height="600" alt="" />
<span class="caption"><i>Plate 13.</i></span>
</div>

<p>Are we to understand from this that these dead bodies had
been mutilated in fair fight torn to pieces for example by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
shells? It may be; but this would be a kindly interpretation
which the documents (<i>Plates 14 and 15</i>) disprove:</p>

<p>Here is a fac simile on a reduced scale from a newspaper
picked up in the German trenches, the <i>Jauersches Tageblatt</i>
of the 18<sup>th</sup> October 1914. Jauer is a town in Silesia,
about 50 kilometres west of Breslau; two battalions of the
154th regiment of the Saxon Infantry are stationed there.
One Sunday (<i>Sonntag, den 18 Oktober</i>) no doubt at the
hour when the inhabitants with their women and children
were going to church, this local newspaper was distributed
in the peaceful little town and in the hamlets and villages
of the district, bearing these headlines.</p>

<p class="center">

<br />
24 SEPTEMBER 1914.<br />
<br />
(<i>A day of honour for our Regiment.<br />
24<sup>th</sup> September 1914.</i>)<br />
</p>

<p>It is the title of an article of two hundred lines, sent
from the front by a soldier of the regiment. Non-commissioned-officer
Klemt. 1. Komp. Infanterie Reg<sup>t</sup> 154.</p>

<p>Klemt tells how on the 24<sup>th</sup> of September his regiment
which had left Hannonville in the morning and supported
on the march by Austrian batteries was suddenly received
by a double fire from artillery and infantry. The losses
were enormous. And yet the enemy was invisible. At last,
however, it was seen that the firing came from above,
from trees where French soldiers were posted. From now
on I shall no longer summarise, but quote. (<i>Plate 16</i>).</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We brought them down like squirrels, and gave them a warm
reception, with blows of the butt and the bayonet: they no
longer need doctors; we are no longer fighting loyal enemies,
but treacherous brigands.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p></blockquote>

<span class="caption"><i>Plate 14.</i></span>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;By leaps and bounds we got across the clearing. They
were here, there, and everywhere hidden in the thicket. Now it
is down with the enemy! And we will give them no quarter.
Every one shoots standing, a few, a very few fire kneeling. No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
one tries to take shelter. We reach a little depression in the
ground: here the red trousers dead or wounded lie on a heap
ground. We knock &#8216;down&#8217; or bayonet the wounded, for we
know that those scoundrels fire at our backs when we have gone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
by. There was a Frenchman there stretched out, full length, face
down, pretending to be dead. A kick from a strong fusilier
soon taught him that we were there. Turning round, he asked
for quarter, but we answered: &#8220;Is that the way your tools work,
you,&mdash;&#8221; and he was nailed to the ground. Close to me I heard
odd cracking sounds. They were blows from a gun on the bald
head of a Frenchman which a private of the 154<sup>th</sup> was dealing
out vigorously; he was wisely using a French gun so as not
to break his own. Tenderhearted souls are so kind to the
French wounded that they finish them with a bullet, but others
give them as many thrusts and blows as they can.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our adversaries had fought bravely, we had to contend
with picked men; they let us get within thirty, even ten metres
of them&mdash;too near. Sacks and arms thrown away in quantities
showed that they had try to run, but at the sight of the
&#8220;grey phantoms&#8221; fear paralyzed them, and on the narrow
path they had to take, German bullets brought them the word
of command, <i>Halt</i>. At the entry into the screen of branches,
there they lay groaning and crying for quarter. But whether
wounded slightly or severely, the brave fusiliers spare their
country the cost of caring for many enemies.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>The narrative goes on, full of literary ornaments. The
writer reports that H. R. H. Prince Oscar of Prussia who
had been told of these brave deeds (perhaps too of others)
of the 154<sup>th</sup> regiment, and of the regiment of grenadiers
who were brigaded with the 154<sup>th</sup> declared that they were
both worthy of the name of <i>Königsbrigade</i>, and ends up
with this sentence &#8220;When evening came, after a prayer of
thanksgiving we fell asleep in the expectation of the morrow&#8221;.
Then the author having added as a postscript a
few more touches in verse takes his composition to his
lieutenant, who affixes his seal thereupon.</p>

seelt alle. Schon werden die ersten Franzmänner entdeckt.
Von den Bäumen werden sie heruntergeknallt
wie Eichhörnchen, unten mit Kolben und Seitengewehr
»warm« empfangen, brauchen sie keinen Arzt mehr,
wir kämpfen nicht mehr gegen ehrliche Feinde, sondern
gegen tückische Räuber. Springend geht&#8217;s über die
Lichtung hinüber&mdash;da! dort! in den Hecken stecken
sie drin, nun aber drauf, Pardon wird nicht gegeben.
Stehend, freihändig, höchstens knieend wird geschossen,
an Deckung denkt niemand mehr. Wir kommen an
eine Mulde, tote und verwundete Rothosen liegen
massenhaft umher, die Verwundeten werden erschlagen
oder erstochen, denn schon wissen wir, daß diese Lumpen,
wenn wir vorbei sind, uns im Rücken befeuern.

Mit der größten Erbitterung wird gekämpft.

Dort liegt ein Franzmann lang ausgestreckt, das
Gesicht auf dem Boden, er stellt sich aber nur tot. Der
Fußtritt eines strammen Musketiers belehrt ihn, daß
wir da sind. Sich umdrehend, ruft er Pardon, aber
schon ist er mit den Worten: »Siehst du, du B ...,
so stechen eure Dinger« auf der Erde festgenagelt.
Neben mir das unheimliche Krachen kommt von den
Kolbenschlägen her, die ein 154er wuchtig auf einen
französischen Kahlkopf niedersausen läßt. Wohlweislich
benutzte er zu der Arbeit ein französisches Gewehr, um
das seinige nicht zu zerschlagen. Leute mit besonders
weichem Gemüt geben verwundeten Franzosen die
Gnadenkugel, die anderen hauen und stechen nach Möglichkeit.
Tapfer haben sich die Gegner geschlagen, es
waren Elitetruppen, die wir vor uns hatten, auf 30-10
Meter ließen sie uns herankommen, dann war&#8217;s
allerdings zu spät. Massenhaft weggeworfene Tornister
und Waffen zeugen davon, daß sie fliehen wollten,
aber das Entsetzen beim Anblick der feldgrauen »Unholde«
hat ihnen die Füße gelähmt und mitten im
schmalen Stege hat ihnen die deutsche Kugel ihr »Stopp«" />

<p>Now, I ask my reader, no matter of what nationality:
can he imagine such an article being printed in his own
language, in the town in which he lives, and read by his
wife and children? In what country, except Germany is
such a thing conceivable? Not in France, at least.</p>

<p>Here is still one further convincing proof of how usual it
is for the German army to mutilate the wounded. It is
taken (<i>Plates 17 and 18</i>) from the diary of P<sup>te</sup> Paul Glöde,
of the 9<sup>th</sup> Battalion of the Pioneers (IX Corps):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;12<sup>th</sup> August 1914. In Belgium.&mdash;It is easy to imagine the
state of fury of our soldiers, when you see the villages that
have been destroyed. There is not one house left undamaged.
All eatables are requisitioned by the soldiers no longer commanded.
We have seen heaps of dead men and women who
had been executed after trial. But the righteous anger
of our soldiers goes hand in hand with sheer vandalism. In
some villages which had already been deserted they &#8220;set up
the red cock&#8221; on all the houses (burnt them). The inhabitants
sadden me. If they use disloyal weapons, after all they are but
defending their country. The atrocities that these civilians
have been and are guilty of are avenged in a savage manner.
<i>Mutilation of the wounded is the order of the day.</i>&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>This was written on the 12<sup>th</sup> of August, only eight days
after innocent Belgium had been invaded, and the wounded
who were tortured were only defending, against Germany
that land, their native land which Germany had sworn to
respect and if necessary to defend. But in many a country,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
the Pharisees who having read these lines will calmly
go to their churches or Chapels, their bank-parlours or
their chancelleries murmuring: &#8220;In what way do these
things concern me? <i>Ja, Ja</i>, it is war&#8221;.</p>

<p>Yes, it is war, but a war such as was never waged by the
soldiers of Marceau, nor ever will be waged by the soldiers
of Joffre, such as never has been nor ever will be waged
by France, &#8220;mother of the arts, of arms and of law&#8221;.
Yes, it is war, but such as even Attila would not have waged,
had he agreed to certain engagements, for, to agree to them
would have been to awake to the conception which <i>alone</i>
distinguishes the civilized man from the barbarian&mdash;the
nation from the horde&mdash;the respect of the given word.&mdash;Yes,
it is war, but a war whose insolent principles could
be constructed only by pedantic megalomaniacs, the Julius
von Hartmanns, the Bernhardis, the Treitschkes; principles
that presume to authorize the people elect to blot
out from the laws and customs of war all the humanity
that centuries of Christianity and chivalry have with difficulty
introduced; principles of systematic ferocity, the
odious side of which is already obvious enough; but still
more the senseless and ridiculous side. Is it not indeed
ridiculous that they should be already obliged to deny it
at least in words,&mdash;they the burners of Louvain,
Malines and Reims, they the assassins of women, children,
and wounded men! and that they should have imposed
upon their slavish ninety-three <i>Kulturträger</i> the denials
which we know so well: &#8220;It is not true, say they,
that we wage war contrary to the laws of nations, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
our soldiers do not commit acts of indiscipline or cruelty<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>&#8221;,
and again: &#8220;We will carry on this war to the bitter end
as a civilised people, for this we will answer in our name
and on our honour&#8221;. Why this pitiful and humble denial?
Perhaps because their theory of war presupposes as a postulate
their invincibility, and as at the first shudder of their
defeat on the Marne it collapsed, they now repudiate it at
the first threat of retaliations.</p>

<p>I shall draw no conclusion: the allied armies who are
marching on towards victory will do that.</p>

<p>General Stenger&#8217;s order of the day, mentioned on page 29
was communicated orally by various officers in various
units of the brigade. Consequently the form in which we
have received it may possibly be incomplete or altered.
In face of any doubt, the French government has ordered an
enquiry to be made in the prisoners&#8217; Camps. Not one
of the prisoners to whom our magistrates presented the
order of the day in the above mentioned form found a
word to alter. They one and all declared that this was the
order of the day which had been orally given in the
ranks, repeated from man to man; many added the names
of the officers who had communicated the order to them;
some related in what a vile way it had been carried out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
under their eyes. All the evidence of these German soldiers
was collected in a legal manner, under the sanction of an
oath, and it is after reading their depositions that I wrote
the order of the day.</p>

<p>The text of all this evidence was transmitted to all
the French embassies and legations in foreign countries on
the 24<sup>th</sup> of Oct. 1914. Every neutral wishing to clear his
conscience is at liberty to obtain it from the representatives
of the French Republic who will certainly respond
willingly.<br /><br /></p>

Grausamkeit</i>» &#8220;cruelty exercised on service&#8221;.</p></div></div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
